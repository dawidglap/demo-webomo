    "title37": "Use of the Scalable Central Measurement Method",
    "description37": "This website uses the measurement method (“SZMnG”) of INFOnline GmbH (https://www.INFOnline.de) to determine statistical metrics on usage of our offers. The goal is to determine, based on a standardized method, the number of visits to our website, the number of website visitors, and their surfing behavior, thus obtaining market‑wide comparable values.\nFor all digital offerings that are members of the Information Community for the Determination of Circulation of Advertising Media (IVW – http://www.ivw.eu) or participate in studies by the Working Group for Online Research e.V. (AGOF – http://www.agof.de), usage statistics are regularly processed by AGOF and the Working Group for Media Analysis e.V. (agma – http://www.agma-mmc.de) into reach and published with the performance value “Unique User,” and by the IVW with the performance values “Page Impressions” and “Visits.” These reach statistics can be viewed on the respective websites.\nLegal basis for processing\nMeasurement using SZMnG by INFOnline GmbH is carried out on the basis of legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.\nPurpose of processing\nPersonal data is processed to create statistics and form user categories. The statistics serve to verify and report the use of our services. User categories form the basis for targeted advertising measures. Measurement that ensures comparability with other market participants is essential for marketing this website. Our legitimate interest arises from the economic value of insights from the statistics and user categories, and the market value of our website—including direct comparison with other websites.\nFurthermore, we have a legitimate interest in making the pseudonymized data of INFOnline, AGOF, and IVW available for market research (AGOF, agma) and statistical purposes (INFOnline, IVW).\nType of data\nINFOnline GmbH collects the following data, which under EU‑GDPR has personal reference:\n• IP address: Needed technically for data transmission on the Internet. IP addresses are truncated by one byte before processing and anonymized. The full IP address is not stored.\n• A randomly generated client identifier: A cookie “ioam.de,” a local‑storage object, or a browser‑signature derived from transmitted browser information. The identifier is unique until the cookie or storage object is deleted. Usage data and assignment to the client identifier are possible across websites using SZMnG. Cookie validity is limited to one year.\nUsage of data\nThe SZMnG method on this website captures usage data to determine performance metrics—Page Impressions, Visits, and Clients—and derive further indicators (e.g. qualified clients). The data is also used as follows:\n• Geolocation based on the anonymized IP address only up to the federal state/region level, with no inference of precise location.\n• Usage data per technical client are aggregated across websites and stored in a database; used to estimate age and gender categories and forwarded to AGOF service providers. In AGOF studies, sociographic models are estimated (e.g. age, gender, nationality, occupation, marital status, household data, income, residence, internet use, interests, usage location, user type).\nData retention\nThe truncated IP address is stored for up to 60 days. Usage data with the unique identifier is stored for up to six months.\nData sharing\nFull or truncated IP addresses are not shared. For AGOF studies, data with client identifiers is shared with AGOF service providers:\n• Kantar Germany GmbH (https://www.tns-infratest.com/)\n• Ankordata GmbH & Co. KG (http://www.ankordata.de/homepage/)\n• Interrogare GmbH (https://www.interrogare.de/)\nRights of the data subject\nYou have the following rights:\n• Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)\n• Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)\n• Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)\n• Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)\n• Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)\n• Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)\nPlease direct any such requests to the contact details at the end of this privacy notice. We must verify your identity before processing.\nRight to object\nTo opt‑out of measurement, visit: https://optout.ioam.de\nTo guarantee exclusion, a cookie must be set; if you delete your cookies, you must repeat the opt‑out process.\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.\nMore information on the data protection of the measurement method is available on the INFOnline site (https://www.infonline.de), AGOF data protection site (http://www.agof.de/datenschutz), and IVW data protection site (http://www.ivw.eu).",
